# schedulling-system
This project is build-up using java 8, spring boot 2.6.6, Java persistence Api(jpa), lombok and h2 for database demo. Also is build using the Modell view controller 
pattern, for the CI it would be great the integration of jenkins and Docker, and for the cloud deployment we can use any of the famouse platforms nowadays like 
google cloud or amazon. For secure the endpoints we can use spring security and if we planning developing more Apis we can use the microservice arquitecture and include
other technologies specifically for this type of arquitecture, for example we can use the netflix oss with spring cloud like eureka, zuul, hystrix, ribbon.
